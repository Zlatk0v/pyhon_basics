# 🌟 Introduction

I am a developer currently enrolled in the **Python** course at *SoftUni*. In this repository, you'll find my solutions to all of the tasks from the **Python Basics** module. Each task has been thoroughly solved and tested.

The tasks in this module are designed to provide a solid foundation in Python, covering topics such as:

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Basic Input/Output**
- **Conditional Statements**
- **Loops**
- **Functions**
- **Lists and Dictionaries**
- **Basic Algorithms**
